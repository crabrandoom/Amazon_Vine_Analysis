Bonus analysis:
- The percnetage of unpaid 1 star reviews was 9562/37000 or 25.8%
- The percentage of paid 1 star reviews was 1/90 or 1.1%

## Summary
Paid reviews had a bias of 48.9/39.7 or 123%. Indicating that customers who were paid to review video game were 23% more likely to give a 5 star rating than the unpaid reviewers. 

Another analysis that could be conducted to confirm this would be on the 1 star reviews. If there is a bias, it would be assumed the frequency of 1 star ratings would be disproportionately less when comparing the paid reviews to the unpaid reviews. Being that these numbers are included in the results we went ahead and included that and the bias was far worse when looking at 1 star reviews.

When paid the 1 star rating frequency wa 1.1% as compared to the 25.8% for unpaid. This would indicate that paid reviews are extremely unlnikely to provide honest feedback in the event of a sub-par product quality.

Another number to consider would be the ratio of 5 star reviews to 1 star for each of the paid and unpaid categories. Again any disproportion would indicate bias in paid reviews.
